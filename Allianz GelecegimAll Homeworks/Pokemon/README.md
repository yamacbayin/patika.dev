# Allianz GeleceƒüimAll Program - Pok√©mon Battle Simulator

## Introduction

This repository contains the homework project for the Allianz GeleceƒüimAll Program. The project is a Pok√©mon Battle Simulator that allows players to pick their trainers, select Pok√©mon, and engage in battles. The simulator keeps track of the wins of each player and determines the ultimate winner based on the number of victories.

## Project Overview

The Pok√©mon Battle Simulator consists of three main classes:

1. `Player`: Represents a player in the game, each associated with a Pok√©mon Trainer and a set of Pok√©mon for battle.

2. `BattleService`: Contains the logic for conducting Pok√©mon battles between two players. The battles take place in rounds, and players select Pok√©mon to fight. The outcome of the battle is determined by the skills and strength of the Pok√©mon, as well as the weather conditions.

3. `GameMaster`: Handles the main game logic, such as setting up players, allowing them to pick trainers and Pok√©mon, and managing the exchange of Pok√©mon after each battle.

## Homework Summary

For the homework assignment, I was tasked with extending and enhancing the existing codebase for the Pok√©mon Battle Simulator. Here's what I did with the code:

- Added Javadoc comments to all methods and classes to provide clear and concise explanations of their purpose and functionality.

- Improved the battle system by allowing players to use skills and trainer powers strategically during the battles.

- Implemented the exchange of Pok√©mon between players after each battle based on the performance of their Pok√©mon.

- Enabled players to select specific skills for their Pok√©mon during the Pok√©mon picking phase.

- Created a realistic weather system that affects Pok√©mon attacks and introduces an element of randomness to the battles.

- Set up a win condition where a player must win a certain number of battles to be declared the ultimate winner of the game.

## How to Run

To run the Pok√©mon Battle Simulator, simply execute the `run()` method in the `GameMaster` class. The simulator will prompt players to enter their names and pick trainers and Pok√©mon. Battles will then be conducted between the players until a winner is determined.

## Conclusion

The Pok√©mon Battle Simulator project for the Allianz Geleceƒüimall Bootcamp was an exciting challenge that allowed me to dive into Java programming and game development. By implementing various game mechanics and improving the battle system, I gained valuable experience in object-oriented programming and design.

Feel free to explore the codebase and make further improvements to enhance the gameplay. Enjoy the Pok√©mon Battle Simulator! üöÄ
